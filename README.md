# Introduction

Calculator is one of the first projects for my programming portfolio. 

# Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS (general knowledge + glassmorphism elements style)
- JavaScript

# Important
Notice that not all of the equations will have a proper result since JavaScript has a specific notation system for numbers. Especially operations with floating point numbers are
fragile.
- events with a point not entirely handled yet.
