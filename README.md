# Introduction

Calculator is one of the first projects for my programming portfolio. 

# Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS (general knowledge + glassmorphism elements style)
- JavaScript (ES6)

# Important
Notice that not all of the equations will have a proper result since JavaScript has a specific notation system for numbers. In particular, operations on floating point numbers are fragile.
- events with a point button and root operations not entirely handled yet.
